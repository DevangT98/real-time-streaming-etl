# Real-Time Data Pipeline with Kafka, Spark & Cassandra | Complete ETL Workflow

This project showcases a complete real-time data engineering pipeline using modern big data tools. It demonstrates how to ingest data from an external API, stream it through Kafka, process it with Spark, and store it in a NoSQL database like Cassandra. The orchestration is handled by Airflow, and everything runs on Docker for easy deployment.

## 📌 Introduction

This end-to-end project demonstrates how to build a real-time streaming ETL pipeline. You'll learn how to:

- Orchestrate workflows using **Apache Airflow**
- Stream data through **Apache Kafka**
- Process streaming data with **Apache Spark**
- Store results in **Apache Cassandra**
- Containerize the whole environment with **Docker**

The source data is fetched from the public `randomuser.me` API, emulating real-world user events in motion.
